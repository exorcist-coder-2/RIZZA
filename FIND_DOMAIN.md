# Finding the "Generate Domain" Button

If you can't find the domain generation section, follow these steps:

1. **Click on your specific service** (the box with "backend" or "RIZZA" on the Railway canvas).
2. A drawer/panel will open on the right (or go to the service page).
3. Click on the **Settings** tab (usually the rightmost tab).
4. Scroll down to the **Networking** section.
5. Look for **"Public Networking"**.
6. You should see a button **"Generate Domain"** or **"Custom Domain"**.

## If you still don't see it:

- **Are you on the Trial plan?** You might need to verify your account (add a payment method, you won't be charged) to enable public domains.
- **Did the build succeed?** If the build failed, you won't get a domain. Check the "Deployments" tab for a red 'X'.

## Once you have the URL:
It will look like: `https://rizza-production-xxxx.railway.app`

Paste it here so we can finish the frontend!
